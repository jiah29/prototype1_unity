This repository stores all C# scipts that I have written throughout the Unity Junior Programmer pathway. This repo does not contain all other game objects/scenes/files required to run the games (only scripts are included in this repo).

- Interpret simple code
- Improve simple code using the features of an IDE
- Use common logic structures to control the execution of code.
- Write code that utilizes the various Unity APIs
- Implement appropriate data types
- Write code that integrates into an existing system
- Implement a code style that is efficient and easy to read
- Prototype new concepts
- Diagnose and fix code that compiles, but fails to perform as expected
- Diagnose and fix common compilation errors
- Diagnose and fix compilation errors related to Unityâ€™s Scripting API
